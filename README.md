# Polkadot Rust & Substrate Bootcamp Final Project

Welcome to the Polkadot Rust & Substrate Bootcamp final project repository! This project brings together various Rust code snippets into a single project while simulating the Substrate network and implementing smart contracts. The goal is to create a blockchain network and add trusted nodes to it.

## Project Overview

- **Creating Blockchain**: The project includes code for creating a simple blockchain network.
- **Simulating Substrate Network**: Simulates the Substrate network environment for testing.
- **Adding Trusted Nodes**: Trusted nodes are added to the network to increase reliability.
- **Smart Contracts**: The project explores the concept of smart contracts within the blockchain.


## While starting

Follow these steps to set up the project locally and start participating in Web3 auctions.

### Prerequisites

- Rust: Make sure Rust is installed on your system. You can download it from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
- Substrate: Create a Substrate development environment by following the instructions [here](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/getting-started/).

### Setup

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yalntue/polkadot_final.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `cargo structure`

### Use

Start project: `cargo run`


## Testing

Smart contract tests are located in the 'tests' folder. These tests ensure the correct functioning of smart contracts. To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal in the project directory.
2. Run the following command to run the tests: `cargo test`

This command will start smart contract tests and display the results in the terminal.
